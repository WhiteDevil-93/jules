| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Set API Key**          | On first use, set your API key to connect to your Jules account. The key is stored securely in VSCode's SecretStorage and used automatically for all subsequent requests.                                          | `jules-extension.setApiKey`         |

| **Monitor Progress in Real-time** | Get an at-a-glance view of Jules's current work status (`Running`, `Active`, `Done`, etc.) in a dedicated sidebar view. No more switching back and forth between your browser and editor.                   | `julesSessionsView`                 |
| **Get Progress Updates** | Curious about how far Jules has progressed? Click the `↻` (refresh) button to instantly fetch and display the latest session status and activity list.                                                              | `jules-extension.refreshSessions`   |

| **Refresh Activities**   | Update the activities view for the current session to see the latest progress.                                                                                                                                     | `jules-extension.refreshActivities` |

## Authentication for GitHub

To check the status of pull requests, the extension needs to authenticate with GitHub.

2.  Run the **`Jules: Sign in to GitHub`** command.
3.  You will be redirected to your browser to authorize the extension.

### GitHub PAT (Deprecated) ⚠️

Using a Personal Access Token (PAT) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please migrate to the OAuth sign-in method for better security and a smoother experience.
