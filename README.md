| **Real-time Monitoring** | Get an at-a-glance view of Jules's current work status (`Running`, `Active`, `Done`, etc.) in a dedicated sidebar view.                                                                                             | `julesSessionsView`                               |

| **Send Message**         | Send follow-up messages to an active Jules session to provide additional instructions or feedback.                                                                                                                 | `jules-extension.sendMessage`                     |
